#Database for terminal.
Hello! I'm isthisprogramming.

I've created a simple Java project and I want to share it with you.
It's an universal database.
You can manage every type of element, and you can make new elements, delete them or other.

Also, you can use more than one type of database.
This is an example: you want to manage books and pens. You can make two type of database (both usable in the same program). Then you can make new voices of the element type you prefer. So you can register two books, three pens et cetera. When you make a database, you can specify the features of the element, and these will be saved in a text file: when you'll make a new voice, programm will ask you to give infos for all the features you saved. So a book has a title, an author etc. And a pen has a colour, a length etc.

So enjoy this program, and help me if you want.
